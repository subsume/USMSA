# History
Men's Sheds began in Australia some twenty years ago (1997).  It originated out of a national health conference which addressed the health of retired men in Australia.  At issue: many men, once retired, suffer loss of place in their community.  They face loneliness, boredom, self-doubt, inactivity and depression, all of which lead to declines in mental and physical health and well-being, which often can lead to early death.

That Conference resulted in an idea.  They called it the Men’s Shed.  Men’s Sheds are now located in 11 countries and total over 1,900 Men's Sheds. A Men's Shed offers a place which includes camaraderie, tools, new interests, shared ideas and a pot of coffee, where guys get together, work on projects, increase their social networks and make new friends in the process. From the beginning it has been a place of teaching and learning where skills are passed on and projects begin.  Those projects strengthen ties between men as well as relationships with their community.  We believe that philosophy and have seen it work.

> If we can give a helping hand to facilitate the process for men across the US or anywhere, then we have made positive steps not only in our lives but more importantly theirs.

We are moving forward in the US creating additional history for the Men's Shed movement. The USMSA was formed in December 2016. There are three sheds operational at this time, (__Honolulu Hawaii__, __Minneapolis Minnesota__, and __Traverse City Michigan__) with a fourth Shed coming online soon in __Platteville Wisconsin__.  We have a long way to go to catch our brothers in other countries. We will be adding to this history as the US movement progresses. If you have questions or comments concerning the US movement, contact us. Check back to this page from time to time and see where we are going.
